# Useful Scripts
This git repository is a collection of — in my opinion — useful scripts that
were written by me (Jakob Kramer).

## textwrap
*textwrap* is a Python 3 script that wraps long lines in files and program
output with proper line breaks, so they fit on the screen.

## fprm
*fprm* is a C program that prints file permissions as “ls” does.
