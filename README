Miscellaneous
=============

This git repository is a collection of random programs that I wrote.

textwrap
--------

*textwrap* is a Python 3 script that wraps long lines in files or
standard output with proper line breaks so they fit on the screen.
This is basically a stripped-down version of “fmt,” it's doing one
thing in a better way though: it understands UTF-8.

fprm
----

*fprm* is a C90 program that prints file permissions of the form
as “ls” does (e.g. “-rwxr-xr-x”).
